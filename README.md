Atom Launcher
=============
An Open Source Game Launcher written in C#.

----------------------
Mainly Minecraft
-----------------
>
This Launcher will be mainly for my minecraft server, but, will be coded to be able to launch other things, once completed.


- Before compiling this please follow the warning at the top of "StringCipher.cs".
- For Minecraft, it requires a downloaded copy of minecraft first via your own login.
- And, before minecraft will run you first have to run it from the real launcher and while its open copy the natives folder it creates to #.#.#-natives. I will add a way for this to automatically happen in the future.
- Works exactly as intended. Allows ONLY people who bought Minecraft to login and launches straight into Minecraft.

|Feel free to use this repository to boost your own projects.

----------------------
More plans in the future involved including another program that creates the database or file structure of which this can get updates from, automatically.
