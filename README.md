This Launcher was coded mainly for this game.

Launch Minecraft directly from this launcher.

- You don't need minecraft to be installed already.
- No need to make a natives folder, the launcher does it automatically.
- Works exactly as intended. Allows ONLY people who bought Minecraft to login and launches straight into Minecraft. The offline mode works, only if you have logged in before.
